		<p> As a child, Mani Jassal was enticed by the arts and culture of her hometown, Punjab, India. When her family moved to Toronto, Jassal was exposed to the new approaches to design and fashion which drove her to pursue her dream of becoming a stylist. Jassal graduated from Ryerson University in Toronto with a degree in fashion design, where she grabbed the attention of many with her first collection presented in her fashion graduate show. Her take on South Asian attire with Indian influences refreshed audiences with the use of lightweight and feathery arrangements rather than heavy looks. </p>
